# Simple-Regression-Implementations
This repository contains implementations of various simple regression models.

Overview
In this project, we implement and compare several regression models including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest (RF)
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Decision Tree
