# Simple-Regression-Implementations
This repository contains implementations of various simple regression models.

Overview
In this project, we implement and compare several regression models including:
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Lasso Regression
Linear Regression
Random Forest (RF)
Ridge Regression
Stacking and Voting Regression (Combining multiple models of choice)
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
